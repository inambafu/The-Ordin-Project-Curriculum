		<h1>Jollof Rice Recipe</h1>

		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p><strong>Jollof rice</strong> is a delicious royal dish originating in West Africa. It is one of the most common West African dishes eaten in the regions of Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, Senegal, Gambia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Cameroun, and Liberia.
                           Although it is believed to have originated from the Wolof people in northwest Senegal.</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<p>The ingredients required for making jollof rice are pretty basic. You probably already have them in your kitchen</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The main ingredient in jollof rice is, of course, <strong>rice</strong>. I used long-grain parboiled rice for this recipe,
		            but you can also use basmati.</li>
			<li>Next up are the canned tomato, fresh tomatoes, bell peppers, scotch bonnet, onions, garlic, and ginger - each of which adds a unique flavour and texture to your dish!</li>
			<li>You&rsquo;ll also need <strong>oil</strong> for frying your sauce - any kind of vegetable oil will do.</li>
			<li>Stock - Chicken, beef, or vegetable stock are great choices here for adding depth of flavour.</li>
			<li>And lastly, there&rsquo;s the <strong>seasoning</strong and herbs - curry powder, salt, black/white pepper, bouillon powder, thyme, and bay leaves</li>
			
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>	
		<p>When cooking Jellof rice, building a flavor base is very important. Don&rsquo;t be in a haste to dump your ingredients in the pot 
		   otherwise, you will end up with what we call a &ldquo;concoction.&rdquo; Each step counts, so try to do each of the steps in detail.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>The inevitable foundation for building up the flavour in this meal is to start by <strong>sauteeing the onions</strong>. This
			    should take about 3 to 5 minutes. The next thing is to stir in the tomato paste. This add a deep and rich tomato flavour; I simply fry this for another 5 minutes or thereabout.</li>
			<li><strong>Add the ginger and garlic</strong> and cook along with the tomato paste for another two minutes; Actually, by the time this is ready, you will notice it in the smell. If you keep it cooking any longer, you might risk burning them.</li>
			<li><strong>Add the blended peppers</strong>. Usually, there is no particular time fram for frying this pepper. I often stop when the sauce becomes really thick, and the oil literally floats on top of the sauce. At this point, most of the water is gone, and the sauce no longer smells raw. Trust me, you will know
				    , but just in case you are still doubt, I would say maybe 15 to 20 minutes depending on the quantity of water in your blended pepper.</li>
			<li>Finally, in building my flavor, I <strong>add the thyme, curry powder, salt, white pepper (good but optional), and seasoning cubes</strong>. Adjust the seasoning at this point if thereis a need to.</strong>
		</ol>
