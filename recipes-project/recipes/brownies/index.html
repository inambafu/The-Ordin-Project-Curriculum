		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>The Best brownie recipe! With crispy edges, fudgy middles, and rich chocolate flavour, these homemad brownies will disappear in no time.</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<p>Back to Michelle&rsquo;s recipe for brownies! In order for it to turn out like (aka better than) the boxed mix, Michelle uses granulated sugar, all-purpose flour, salt, and chocolate chips. Then, she adds these key ingredients:<p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>2 eggs + water</strong> - Michelle uses a bit of water with eggs to achieve the moist, gooey texture of boxed mix brownies without any commercial
				    emulsifiers. And because this recipe doesn&rsquo;t contain any baking powder, eggs are essential for helping the brownies puff up in the oven.</li>
			<li><strong>Powdered sugar</strong> - The trick to making homemade brownies that are just like ones from a box! Powdered sugar contains cornstarch, which helps thicken the batter without the chemical additives you&rsquo;d find in a mix.</li>
			<li><strong>Unsweetened cocoa powder</strong> - Michelle recommends using Hershey&rsquo;s Special Dark Dutch-processed cocoa powder (I used Whole Foods&rsquo; 365 Cocoa Powder). Make sure to sift it if it&rsquo;s lumpy!</li>
			<li><strong>Oil</strong> - While many recipes for brownies use unsalted butter, Michelle&rsquo;s calls for canola oil, just like the boxed mix. I usee olive oil because it&rsquo;s what I keep on hand, and I love the rich flavor.</li>
			<li><strong>Vanilla Extract</strong> - 1/2 teaspoon vanilla really amps up the chocolate flavor.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<p>How to Make Brownies from Scratch</p>
		<ol>
			<li>First, mix together the dry and wet ingredients in two separate bowls. Combine the sugar, flour, 
			    powdered sugar, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, and salt in a medium bowl. Then, whisk together the eggs, olive oil,
			    and water in a large one.</li>
			<li>Next, combine the wet and dry ingredients. Sprinkle the dry mixture over the wet one, and fold until just combined. The batter will be thick!</li>
			<li>Then, pour the batter into an 8*8 inch baking pan lined with parchment paper. Use a rubber spatula to spread it to all four sides of the pan and to smooth the top. The mixture will be very thick - that&rsquo;s ok.</li>
			<li>Finally, bake! Transfer the pan to a 325-degree oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, untill a toothpick inserted comes out with a few crumbs attached. Allow the brownies to cool completely before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
